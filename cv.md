At present I am studying at university and doing my third year. Being a diligent student, I am studying 3 foreign languages (English, Spanish and Arabic)

I have always been attracted by an IT sphere as I am intrested in modern technologies. I consider the world of IT to be one of the most saturated and astonishing line. I wish I had entered some IT department, but at the age of 17 I wasn't shrewd enough. But this year I am planning to change the university and enter the department of bisness and IT.

I also worked as a tutor and it helped me a lot to hit it off with different people, because communication skills are obligatory skills!

I have little knowledge yet and a strong desire to develop and create cool things!
I am ready to make efforts and gain all necessary experience and skills and to be a real asset to your company :)
